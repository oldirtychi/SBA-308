//     // e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another
//     // would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.
//     "avg": number,
//     // each assignment should have a key with its ID,
//     // and the value associated with it should be the percentage that
//     // the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)

//     // if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either

// OBJECTIVE: Create a function named getLearnerData() that accepts these values as 
// parameters, in the order listed: (CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission]), 
// and returns the formatted result, which should be an array of objects as described 
// above
